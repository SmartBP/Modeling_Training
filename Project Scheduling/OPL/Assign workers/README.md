# Workers assignment

For this example, we are going to create a basic project scheduling model. We will take into account worker assignments and costs.

We consider the following instance:
- We have a project with a list of tasks that need to be performed 
- Each task has requirements to be fulfilled by the available workers
- Each worker has different skills and an expertise level needed to fulfill the requirements
- Each worker has a fixed and a variable cost for performing a requirement
- Tasks have precedence behavior; some tasks cannot start before another one starts or ends
- Parent tasks are defined, a parent tasks define the span of a group of tasks
