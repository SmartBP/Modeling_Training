## IBM Watson Studio

[IBM Watson Studio](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-studio) is a platform software for data science. The advantage of using Watson is having a workspace that includes multiple collaboration and open-source tools such as RStudio, Spark and Python, all in an integrated environment. 

As you create a new project, you can add multiple collaborators, all having access to various predictive and prescriptive analytics models. Data can be accessed through Watson Data Platform, on-premise or on the cloud.
