# Machine Learning + Decision Optimization

While machine learning can take into account all available data and past history to predict the likelihood of failure for a given machine, decision optimization (DO) can take it a step further and generate a schedule that is optimal for a set of machines, subject to limited resources (e.g. maintenance crew availability), other constraints and dependencies (production plan and repair costs), and optimization metrics (minimizing total cost, maximizing customer satisfaction/meeting planned production, minimizing late maintenance).

As is the case with any business solution, it is not enough to create a model. Our ultimate goal should be a solution delivered in the hands of business users and decision makers. This is true no matter what technology is being used, and the methodology will be similar (Yana Ageeva, 2018).
