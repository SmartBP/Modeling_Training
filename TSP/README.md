# Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)

The travelling salesman problem (also called the travelling salesperson problem or TSP) asks the following question: "Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city and returns to the origin city?"

It is an NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization, important in theoretical computer science and operations research. The travelling purchaser problem and the vehicle routing problem are both generalizations of TSP.

## TSP applications

- Vehicle routing
- Order-picking in Warehouse
- Computer wiring
- Drilling of printed circuit boards
- Mask plotting in PCB production
- Overhauling gas turbine engines
- X-Ray crystallography
- Scheduling problems
- Mission planning
- Navigation satellite system surveying networks

This modeling example is at the advanced level, where we assume that you know Python and the CPLEX Python API and you have advanced knowledge of building mathematical optimization models.
